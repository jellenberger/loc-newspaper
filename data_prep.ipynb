       "  'data': {'caption': 'MIDSUMMER FANCIE\\nWhy should we speculate about fashions, past or present? For, after all, from a modish point of view the \"have beens\" of yesterday and the \"may bes\" of to-morrow are of but little importance if only the styles of today are of the type to make life interesting, even though war Is raging throughput the land.\\nAnd that they most certainly are! So the pessimist who prophesied a dearth of beauty in the realm of summer dress is without honor in his own country, and no one is paying any heed to his calamatous croakings about the direful state of the autumn modes.\\nFor if the poor old calamity howler made a mistake in the one instance he probably would in the other. And make a mistake he assuredly did, for never have clothes been more alluringly attractive than they are at present.\\nOld Mother Nature believes in just enough variety to make us appreciate her perfections, but in midsummer she is particularly generous and gives to us of her very best. And to show that she appreciates her lavishness the August maid blossoms forth in apparel that matches the weather.\\nNow is the time for the girl who is a lover of sheer raiment to indulge her fancy. What, for example, is more charming, and incidentally more \"comfy,\" for wear on warm afternoons than a pretty frock of organdie or of voile?\\nDead white is trying to certain types, but a creamy tint is universally becoming.\\nUnusually smart, but at the same time, delightfully simple, is the cream colored dress in which milady of the knitting needles looks so well.\\nDeep bands of cream filet lace contribute that completesness of conception which always compels admiration, and the frock has attained a degree of ultra-perfection by the addition of a soft satin girdle and loop ends of old rose.\\nA slipover blouse is a handy little garment to possess, and the one shown here is developed in turquoise blue in a silk and wool weave. Cream wool is employed to edge the novel little affair and also to fashion the corded girdle.\\nThe more summery the day the more charming must be the hat that milady wears.\\nFit for any fete is the wide brimmed chapeau cf white Milan, which is lightly veiled in blue Georgette, and carries a wealth of field flowers under a soft cloud of tulle.\\nStreamers of palest lavender, pink and green in no wise from, but rather do they add to the beauty of the hat.\\nIf we return to the busy knitter for a moment we notice that she has shown equally as good taste In the choice of her chapeau as of her frock.',\n",
